## Architecture Overview

zig_llms is a lightweight LLM agent framework inspired by go-llms and Google's Agent Development Kit. The library provides:

1. **âœ… Modular LLM Provider System**: Unified interface (`provider.zig`) with complete OpenAI implementation, registry system, and metadata discovery
2. **âœ… HTTP Infrastructure**: Robust HTTP client with connection pooling, request/response handling, and JSON serialization
3. **âœ… Testing Framework**: Comprehensive testing utilities with scenarios, mocks, matchers, and fixtures  
4. **âœ… Memory Management**: Short-term conversation history with ring buffer and token counting
5. **âœ… Agent System**: BaseAgent with lifecycle management, LLMAgent implementation, thread-safe state management
6. **âœ… Tool System**: Extensible tool framework with 8 built-in tools, discovery, validation, persistence
7. **âœ… Workflow Engine**: Multi-step task orchestration with sequential, parallel, conditional, loop patterns
8. **âœ… Hook System**: Comprehensive lifecycle hooks with metrics, logging, tracing, validation, caching
9. **âœ… Event System**: Event emitter with filtering, recording, and replay functionality
10. **âœ… Output Parsing**: JSON parser with recovery and schema-guided extraction
11. **âœ… C-API Bindings**: Complete C-API with memory management and error handling
12. **âœ… Universal Scripting Engine Infrastructure**: VTable-based interface with 10 comprehensive API bridges

## Development Guidelines

1. **Build System**: The project uses Zig's built-in build system. A Makefile should be created with standard targets (build, test, format, lint) as per coding guidelines.

2. **Testing**: Centralize testing utilities in reusable helpers, mocks, fixtures and scenarios. Tests go in `test/` directory.

3. **Module Structure**: 
   - All public APIs are exported through `src/main.zig`
   - Each major feature has its own module file
   - Provider implementations live in `src/providers/` subdirectory
   - Memory subsystems are in `src/memory/`
   - HTTP infrastructure in `src/http/`
   - Testing utilities in `src/testing/`
   - Tool system in `src/tools/` with 8 built-in tools
   - Workflow engine in `src/workflow/` with pattern implementations
   - Hook system in `src/hooks/` with comprehensive lifecycle support
   - Event system in `src/events/` with filtering and persistence
   - Output parsing in `src/outputs/` with recovery mechanisms
   - C-API bindings in `src/bindings/` with memory management
   - Scripting engine infrastructure in `src/scripting/` with universal API bridges

4. **Current State**: The project has completed Phases 1-9 (Foundation through Scripting Engine Infrastructure). All major systems are implemented and tested. Ready for Phase 10 (Lua Engine) implementation.
