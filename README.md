# zig_llms: A Lightweight LLM Agent Framework in Zig

zig_llms (zig.llms) is an upcoming library for the Zig programming language, designed to provide a robust and efficient foundation for building AI-powered agents. Inspired by the capabilities and goals of libraries like go-llms and the agentic scripting potential seen in projects like go-llmspell, zig_llms aims to deliver high performance, memory safety, and fine-grained control, leveraging the strengths of Zig.

## Vision

The core vision behind zig_llms is to:

1.  **Simplify LLM Integration**: Offer a clean, unified API to interact with various Large Language Models (LLMs), both cloud-based (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) and local (e.g., via Ollama, llama.cpp).
2.  **Empower Agent Creation**: Provide a lightweight yet powerful infrastructure for developing autonomous agents capable of reasoning, planning, and executing tasks.
3.  **Facilitate Tool Use**: Enable agents to seamlessly use external tools and APIs to augment their capabilities and interact with the world.
4.  **Enable Complex Workflows**: Support the definition and execution of multi-step workflows, allowing agents to tackle more complex problems.
5.  **Promote Interoperability**: Expose a C-API to allow zig_llms to be easily integrated into other programming environments, particularly scripting languages like Lua, enabling rapid development of agentic applications.
6.  **Prioritize Performance and Safety**: Utilize Zig's features to create a library that is not only fast and memory-efficient but also robust and predictable.4

## Inspirations
1. https://github.com/lexlapax/go-llms/README.md and it's architecture https://github.com/lexlapax/go-llms/blob/main/docs/technical/architecture.md and agentic setup https://github.com/lexlapax/go-llms/blob/main/docs/technical/agents.md 
2. which itself is based on google agent development kit https://google.github.io/adk-docs/ 
3. the intent for this library is so that we can create other dependent lightweight wrappers with bridges for scripts to call llms and create agents in a lightweight way inspired by https://github.com/lexlapax/go-llmspell/README.md

## coding guidelines
1. centralize testing utilities in a set of helpers, mocks, fixtures and scenarios that can be reused.
2. create a makefile with build, test, format, lint etc targets and run them after every implementation.
