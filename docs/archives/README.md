# Archived Research Documents

This directory contains research documents that have been archived after being synthesized into comprehensive architecture documents.

## Lua Engine Research (Archived 2025-06-16)

The following Lua engine research documents have been synthesized into `docs/LUA_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md`:

- `lua_state_analysis.md` - lua_State lifecycle and memory management research
- `lua_type_conversion_design.md` - ScriptValue â†” Lua type conversion system design
- `lua_coroutine_integration_plan.md` - Coroutine integration for async operations
- `lua_security_design.md` - Security sandboxing approach and threat analysis
- `lua_engine_implementation_roadmap.md` - Detailed implementation roadmap and timeline
- `lua_bytecode_security_research.md` - Bytecode validation and security implications
- `lua_warning_system_integration.md` - Lua 5.4 warning system integration
- `lua_gc_analysis.md` - Generational vs incremental GC trade-offs analysis
- `lua_debug_introspection.md` - Debug introspection capabilities for development tools

These documents contain the detailed research that informed the unified architecture design. They are preserved here for reference and historical context.
